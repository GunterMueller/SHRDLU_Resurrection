This is a SHRDLU resurrection project.

This project is a revival of Terry Winograd's famous SHRDLU computer
language project.  SHRDLU was a program meant to 'understand' language
in a way that is not usually done any more.  By giving SHRDLU
knowledge of a limited domain of blocks, boxes, and pyramids, and
grounding the symbols of its language with the 'objects' of its world,
SHRDLU was able to have very sophisticated conversations about the
things it knows about.

Sadly, SHRDLU was originally written in a now-dead dialect of Lisp.
It was revived in the 1990s and ported to CLisp.  (Read more about the
1990s SHRDLU resurrection at: http://www.semaphorecorp.com/misc/shrdlu.html)


Note: the java code is from http://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/download/javashrdlu.zip.
The Lisp code from the javashrdlu.zip is in Shrdlu_Sources/LISP/ORIG.


The Lisp Code in  Shrdlu_Sources/LISP  is from "https://github.com/tsgouros/www-shrdlu/tree/master/src", since it's cleaner code.
